# QregUI
A Java based Semantic Search tool
Qreg stands for Quranic Research Group. Our search tool still on development level. So still one can search using selection based 
search.

Our main KB is in OWL/RDF(Resource Description Framework). To extract the data's from it we have used SPARQL(SPARQL Query Language).

In Java to read, write and searching users question and getting it's answer using SPARQL we take the help of Apache Jena API.

#Dependencies
1. Apache Jena 3 API 
2. JDK 8
